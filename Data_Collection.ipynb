First i had to use the artists name to navigate to their page on the site, this page displays all of the artists songs and other metadata including genre. I scraped this page for all of the links to the artists songs, which i will use to scrape the lyrics, as well as the genres associated with the artist. Last i navigated to every link that i collected and scraped all the lyrics for all the songs i had collected."
